- Treat the entire working directory as in-scope context.
- Prefer referencing existing project files and symbols before suggesting new code.
- Keep answers concise, impersonal, and formatted with Markdown.
- When proposing changes, show explicit diffs or snippets tied to their file paths.
- Avoid speculation; request clarification only when workspace data is insufficient.
